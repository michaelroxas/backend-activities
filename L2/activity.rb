# 1. Write a program that checks to see if the number appears in the array

# arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]

# puts "Is your number in the array?"
# number = gets.to_i
# arr.each { |element| puts true if number === element }


# 2. Write a program that takes a number from the user bet 0 and 100 and reports back whether the number is between 0 and 50, 51 and 100, or above 100

# puts "Enter a number from 1-100"
# number_input = gets.to_i 

# if number_input <= 50
#     puts "your number is somewhere between 0 to 50."
# elsif number_input >= 51 && number_input < 100
#     puts "your number is somewhere between 51 to 100"
# else 
#     puts "bro who got you smiling that?"
# end

# 3. Write a while-loop that takes input from the user, performs an action, and only stops when the user types "Stop". Each looop can get info from the user



# 4. Write a program that checks to see if the number is divisible by 2 and store them into a new array

arr4 = [6,3,1,8,4,2,10,65,102]
